Overview:
---------
This repository contains code for a text classification project that aims to distinguish between texts generated by AI and those written by humans. 
The project involves exploring the dataset, performing data analysis, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

Project Structure:
------------------
data/: Directory containing the dataset (AI_Human.csv).

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

Results:
--------
The main findings of the project include:

Achieved a high accuracy of 99.05% using logistic regression for text classification.

Explored the most common words in human-generated and AI-generated texts.

Visualized the distribution of text lengths in the dataset.

Analyzed the topics identified in human-generated and AI-generated texts using LDA.
